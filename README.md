# Cornell CLI

So it's like Cornell info on your Terminal. 

# NOTE: THE STUFF HERE DOESNT WORK YET. THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.


## Install

If you have node: `npm install -g cornell`

### I don't have node /:

If you don't have node installed, you can use the install script using cURL:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh | bash

or using Wget:

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh | bash

This will

1. Set up nvm
2. Install the latest iojs
3. Install cornell

You can also do all of the above manually if you don't trust scripts. Or look at [the source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.1/install.sh) and follow along.
